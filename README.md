# Wu-Tang Clan name generator
This is a simple Wu-Tang name generator script made in the Python programming language.

If you are familiar with the Wu-Tang Clan, you know that some popular names, like Childish Gambino, were created using the [original Wu-Tang Clan Name Generator](https://wutangnamefor.me).
So, I decided to create a similar name generator on GitHub.

## How this name generator works
When you input your name, this name generator will provide you with a cool rapper name. However, this script uses only a predefined list of names. If you want to experience the original Wu-Tang name generator, please visit the link above.

## How to install
Follow these steps to install and run this Python script on your PC:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:

- This script requires Python to be installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website.
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3


### Clone the Repository

1. Open your command line interface (e.g., Terminal on macOS/Linux, Command Prompt on Windows).

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command.

3. Clone the repository by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/W-Donald-Glover/wu-name-generator
   ```
## Development
You can add your own combinations of words, such as nouns, verbs, and more. In the first version, I included the names of Wu-Tang Clan members as a tribute to them: RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa.

In the future, I hope to expand this name generator to use different programming languages like C#, HTML, Flutter, etc.

Please communicate in the English language.
